Abstract class "graph" is implemented. The adjacency list representation is chosen as the base representation. The main constructor takes as input the number of vertices in the graph and creates an empty graph.

Implemented descendant classes "undirected graph", "directed graph", "weighted graph".

Implemented basic graph representation operations:
1) adding a new vertex;
2) adding a new edge;
3) deletion of the existing vertex;
4) removal of an existing rib;
   
An internal converter between representations in the form of an adjacency matrix and representations in the form of adjacency lists has been implemented.

Realized generation of a random graph in the Erdes-Renya model

Implemented connectivity check using recursive DFS and Warshell's algorithm.
